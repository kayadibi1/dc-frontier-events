# BACKLOG — dc-frontier-events (ranked, highest leverage first)

## Done
- ~~Layer-2 CSET (Georgetown) scraper~~ ✅ iteration 2 (curl_cffi + selectolax; 10 events, 9 kept).
- ~~Layer-2 CSIS scraper~~ ✅ iteration 3 (httpx + selectolax, date+time+tz; 13 events, 1 on-topic).
- ~~Emit UTC timezone fix~~ ✅ iteration 3 (aware datetimes normalized to `...Z`).
- ~~Upcoming-window feeds~~ ✅ iteration 4 (`events-upcoming.ics`/`feed-upcoming.xml`; 5 live).
- ~~/map web view + events.json~~ ✅ iteration 5 (Leaflet map, 51 pins; JSON export).
- ~~Relevance ranking~~ ✅ iteration 6 (`rank.py`; `feed-top.xml`; score in JSON/map).
- ~~Weekly digest generator~~ ✅ iteration 7 (`digest.py` → `digest.md`, ranked).
- ~~Generic iCal adapter + GWU (Layer 3)~~ ✅ iteration 8 (3 layers live; 4 big-names surfaced).
- ~~README + CLI~~ ✅ iteration 9 (argparse `--out/--db/--today`; full README).
- ~~Expand + precision-test big-name watchlist~~ ✅ iteration 10 (frontier labs/chip makers/leaders; Intel lookahead).
- ~~Alerting~~ ✅ iteration 11 (`alerts.py`/`alerts.md`; new-since-last-run via store; idempotent).

### Enhancement portfolio (autonomous; spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-29-aggregator-enhancements-design.md)
- ~~F1 multi-day series dedupe~~ ✅ (pass 3; AI+EXPO 3→1; 264 dupes removed).
- ~~F2 interactive map UX~~ ✅ (filter/search/cluster; sidebar list synced to map).
- ~~F3 HTML digest~~ ✅ (`render_html` → `digest.html`, self-contained).
- ~~F4 pluggable emailer~~ ✅ (`notify.py`; dry-run `.eml`, SMTP when env set).
- ~~F5 Postgres backend + fallback~~ ✅ (`PostgresStore`/psycopg2; selection+fallback tested; live needs a server).
- ~~F6 archive feed + last_seen~~ ✅ (`events-archive.ics`; ON CONFLICT upsert; gone-from-sources report).
- ~~F7 more Luma sources~~ ✅ (added AI Tinkerers DC +3 incl. Databricks big-name; DC Tech Meetup).

**Enhancement portfolio COMPLETE (F1–F7).** Remaining ideas below are blocked on externals or are future polish.

## Ranked (genuinely remaining after the 12 iterations + F1–F7 portfolio)
Implementation plans for these live in `docs/superpowers/plans/`; execution status in PROGRESS.md.
- ~~CSET/CSIS detail-page speaker enrichment~~ ✅ executed P1 (machinery + person-only big-name match; live data has no watchlisted speakers yet).
- ~~Cross-language / fuzzy dedupe~~ ✅ executed P3 (token-set pass 4 + optional embeddings).
- ~~Archiving partition + store pruning~~ ✅ executed P4 (`status` active/archived, `mark_archived`/`prune`).

- ~~ICS enrichment~~ ✅ executed P5 (per-event `COLOR` + 1-day `VALARM` on upcoming).
- ~~More Layer-2 sources: Brookings~~ ✅ added 2026-05-30 (`fetchers/brookings.py`; `article`-card
  adapter; 14 fetched → 3 on-topic AI kept; json/ics parity 109==109 verified; verify-first).
- ~~More Layer-2 sources: CNAS~~ ✅ added (`fetchers/cnas.py`; `figure.photo-listing__item` cards;
  live E2E 2026-06-02: 18 fetched → 4 on-topic AI kept).
- ~~More Layer-2 sources: Atlantic Council~~ ✅ added (`fetchers/atlanticcouncil.py`; curl_cffi/WAF,
  `div.gta-event-embed--container`; live E2E 2026-06-02: 4 fetched → 1 on-topic AI kept).

Remaining:
1. **Even more Layer-2/3 sources** — each a bespoke adapter (probed 2026-05-30):
   - **Hudson** (`/events`, curl_cffi): truncated "Learn More" link text + current listing is all
     geopolitics (0 AI/chip). Revisit only when Hudson schedules AI events (detail-date adapter was
     prototyped then backed out for 0 yield).
   - Probed-dead: ITIF (2 links), RAND (sub-site links);
     university iCal UMD/Georgetown/Howard/American/VT/UMBC (404/403/0/DNS/SSL).
   - LESSON (cost 3 bad commits this/prior session): hand-written fixture tests give FALSE
     confidence. Verify any new adapter against the live page / a saved REAL fixture (≥1 on-topic
     kept event) AND a live pipeline run with json/ics parity **before** committing. Brookings was
     the redo that followed this and shipped clean.
2. **Live ops (no new code)** — enable the SMTP emailer (`SMTP_*` env) and Postgres
   (`DATABASE_URL`); both code-complete + fallback-tested, just need creds/a server (plan P6).
